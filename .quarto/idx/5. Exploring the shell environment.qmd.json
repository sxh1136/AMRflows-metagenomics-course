Exploring Your Environment","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"### Navigating Files and Directories\n\nNow that you've become acquainted with launching your command line interface and using shell, let's delve into the practical aspects - managing your files and directories.\n\n### Navigating the Terrain\n\nOur first task is to master navigation on the command line:\n\n* Type `cd` (short for \"change directory\") followed by a directory name, such as `cd` Documents, and press Enter. We will go over how to move up the directory tree later in this section.\n\n* If you ever find yourself disoriented and need to return to your starting point, simply type `cd` without any additional arguments and press Enter. This will take you to your home directory. \n\n### Location Awareness\n\nIf you are not sure what directory you are in and what the directory tree is you can use this command:\n\n* Type `pwd` (short for \"print working directory\") and press Enter. This will print your absolute path - more on that later.\n\n\n### File and Directory Management\n\nNow let's look at how to create and delete files and directories.\n\n#### Creating Files and Directories\n\n* To create a new directory, type `mkdir` DirectoryName and press Enter. Replace DirectoryName with your desired directory name.\n\n* To generate a new text file, type `touch` FileName.txt and press Enter. Insert your chosen name after FileName. It's akin to composing a new document.\n\n### Deleting Files and Directories\n\nLet's also learn how to delete files and directories:\n\n* To delete a file, type `rm` FileName.txt and press Enter. This is not reversable!\n\n* To delete an entire directory, type `rm -r` DirectoryName and press Enter.  This is not reversable!\n\n\n### Copying and Relocating\n\nNow, let's learn how to move and copy files.\n\n#### Copying Files and Directories\n\nTo duplicate a file, type `cp` SourceFile.txt DestinationDirectory/ and press Enter. Substitute `SourceFile` with the file to be duplicated and `DestinationDirectory` with the target directory. This will make a copy of `SourceFile` in the `DestinationDirectory`.\n\n```bash\ncp SourceFile.txt DestinationDirectory/\n```\n\n#### Moving Files and Directories\n\nTo move a file instead, type `mv` SourceFile.txt DestinationDirectory/ and press Enter. \n\n```bash\nmv SourceFile.txt DestinationDirectory/\n```\n\n### Renaming Files and Directories\n\nOccasionally, you may want to rename your files and directories:\n\nTo rename a file, we again use the `mv` command, except this this we give it put its new name after the file name instead of a destination directory.\n\n```bash\nmv OldFileName.txt NewFileName.txt\n```\n    \nTo rename a directory, we do the same thing as with a file, but give it a new directory name:\n\n```bash\nmv OldDirectoryName/ NewDirectoryName/\n```\n\n### Viewing Files\n\nIn your research, you'll often need to inspect the **content** of files, whether they contain DNA sequences, metadata, or analysis results. Let's explore some commonly used commands for viewing the contents of files within your command-line environment.\n\n#### Viewing Text Files\n\nText files are frequently used in bioinformatics for storing data and information. To view the contents of a text file, you can use the following commands:\n\n* `cat`: This command displays the entire contents of a text file directly in your terminal. For instance, to view the contents of a file called `sequence.txt`, you would use:\n\n```bash\ncat sequence.txt\n```\n\n* `less`: This command allows you to view large text files one screen at a time, making it easier to navigate through lengthy documents. To use less, simply type:\n\n```bash\nless sequence.txt\n```\n\nYou can navigate through the file using the arrow keys and exit by pressing q.\n\n\n* `head` and `tail`: These commands display the first or last few lines of a file, respectively. For example, to view the first 10 lines of a file:\n```bash\nhead -n 10 sequence.txt\n```\n\nTo view the last 20 lines of a file:\n```bash\ntail -n 20 sequence.txt\n```\n\n#### Searching text files.\nIf you want to search text files for a specific pattern or string we can use the bash command `grep`. \n\nLets assume we had a file called `fruitprices.txt` that looks like this:\n\n    Fruit   Price\n    Pineapple   40\n    Mango   60\n    Banana  20\n    Peach   25\n\nIf we wanted to check the price of mangos we would use:\n```bash\ngrep \"mango\" fruitprices.txt\n```\nWhich would return:\n```bash\nMango 60\n```\n\nAs we can see, `grep` returns the entire line that the search pattern is found in. By default it is not case-sensitive. \n\nIf `fruitprices.txt` looked like this instead:\n\n    Fruit   Price\n    Pineapple   40\n    Mango   60\n    Banana  20\n    Peach   25\n    Big mango   70\n\nAnd we used the same command as above, it would return:\n```bash\nMango 60\nBig mango 70\n```\n\nNotice that `grep` returns every single line that contians the pattern/string we searched for. `grep` has a lot of different flags and options that changes its behaviour and make it a very powerful tool. Make sure to use `--help` to find out more. \n\n### Understanding Absolute and Relative Paths\n\nWhen navigating the command line, it's crucial to understand how to specify the location of files and directories accurately. This is where the concepts of absolute and relative paths come into play.\n\n#### Absolute Paths\n\nAn absolute path provides the complete and unambiguous location of a file or directory in the file system, starting from the root directory. The root directory is the top level of the directory tree and contains all directories below it. It is represented by a single forward slash (`/`). \n\nFor example, if your home directory is `/home/username` (the directory you enter when you type `cd`) and you want to view a file called `data.txt` located in the Documents directory within your home directory, you would use the absolute path like this:\n\n```bash\nless /home/username/Documents/data.txt\n```\n\nAbsolute paths are useful when you need to access files or directories from anywhere in the file system, regardless of your current working directory. They specify the precise location without any ambiguity.\n\n#### Relative Paths\n\nIn contrast, relative paths specify the location of a file or directory relative to your current working directory. They are typically shorter and more convenient to use, as we often don't want to type the absolute path when a file in many directories deep.\n\nHere are some examples of relative paths:\n\n* To view the `data.txt` file in your current directory, you can simply use its name:\n\n```bash\nless data.txt\n```\n\n* To access a file or directory in a subdirectory, you can use a path relative to your current directory. For instance, to view the `config.txt` file in a directory called `settings` located within your current directory:\n\n```bash\nless settings/config.txt\n```\n\n\n* To move up one directory level, you can use `..`. For example, if you are in the `settings` directory and want to view  a file in the parent directory:\n\n```bash\nless ../parentfile.txt\n```\n\nRelative paths are handy when you are working within a specific context, such as organizing files within a project directory.\n\nThese relative and absolute paths work with all commands not just ones to look at text files. For example, if you wanted to navigate around we use the `cd` command we introduced earlier.\n\nWe use `pwd` and find that we are in `/home/username/Documents/amrflows/`. `pwd` always prints out the absolute path. We want to move up a directory back into `/home/username/Documents/`. \n\n* We could move there using absolute paths:\n\n```bash\ncd /home/username/Documents/\n```\n\n* or we could recognise that we only want to move up one directory and can use relative paths:\n\n```bash\ncd ../\n```\n\nSee how much shorter the command is. This becomes important when our commands become more complicated.  \n\n\n#### Previous Commands\nYou can easily access **previous commands** you have executed by pressing the up arrow key. This will allow you to step back command-by-command and quickly rerun things or check what you've written.\n\n#### Connection loss \n* **Note**: this is only relevant if you're connecting to a server. You can skip this section if you are running your commands locally on your own computer. \n  \nIf you've connected to a server through SSH protocol, and you lose connection through internet failure, terminal crashing, or just closing your laptop/computer, you'll lose **all progress** on what you're currently working on. For example, if you are in the middle of running a program that takes hours or days to complete, you will have to start from the **beginning**. \n\nTo avoid this, we can use a program called `screen`. Screen is a virtual command line within a command line which continues to function even when connection is lost. To start a screen we can use the command:\n\n```bash\nscreen -S <screen_name>\n```\n\nYou can exit a screen using:\n\n```bash\nscreen -d\n```\n\nYou can get a list of the screen instances running on your server with:\n\n```bash\nscreen -ls \n```\n\nYou can reattach to your screen of choice with `screen -r` followed by the name or number of the screen given by `screen -ls`.\n\n### Recap and Excerice\n\nThat was quite a bit to digest, but don't fret if you can't recall everything immediately. The most effective way to become proficient is through practice.\n\n#### Exercise \n\n* Move into your home directory.\n* Create a new directory called \"Metagenomics_Project.\"\n* Move into the new directory\n* Generate a new text file named \"SampleData.txt.\"\n* Move the \"SampleData.txt\" file to your home directory (the starting location when you open your command line). \n* Rename the file to \"MyData.txt.\"\n* List the contents of your home directory to verify that everything is in its rightful place.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example code for exercise</summary>\n\n```bash\ncd\nmkdir Metagenomics_Project \ncd Metagenomics_Project \ntouch SampleData.txt \nmv SampleData.txt ../ \ncd ../\nmv SampleData.txt MyData.txt \nls\n```\n</details>\nCongratulations!
